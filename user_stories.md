# User Stories
## Marketing Team
As a marketing team member, I want:
+ a market analysis on proposed products... so that... we know the best products to publish in catalog.
+ #s clicked for each proposed item... so that... we know it's level of popularity.
+ % clicked for each item... so that... we know the item's popularity relative to other items.
+ fresh look and feel for the site... so that... users have a more humanized, user-friendly, and positive experience.

## Development Team
As a development team member, I want:
+ # times image is showing... so that... we can calculate the %.
+ to not show the results until after 25 clicks... so that... we have untainted data.
+ make experience more humanized, user friendly (font type and size, color palette, layout)... so that... users are satisfied with the experience.
+ no dupes... so that... we have accurate data.
+ only 3 images show at a time... so that... clean, clear easier for user, and better data.
